        <br><li><font color="deep pink"> Input:</font> It is the process of providing data and instructions to the computer. Input 
        devices are used to enter data and instructions in the computer system.Some example of input devices are 
        keyboard,mouse,scanner,and microphone.</li>
        
       <br> <li><font color="deep pink">Process:</font> It is the process of executing or calculating the data as per the instructions 
        provided by the user. It is done by CPU (Central Processing Device).</li>
        
        <br><li><font color="deep pink">Output:</font>The result after processing is called output.The output is provided to the user 
        through output devices. Some example of output devices are monitor,speaker and printer.</li>
        
       <br> <li><font color="deep pink">Storage/Memory:</font>The computer can store data either temporarily or permanentally. Memory 
        devices are used to store data. Some examples of memory devices are RAM,ROM,Hard disk,CD and DVD.</li>
        
       <br> <li><font color="deep pink">Feedback:</font>Feedback of the output can be used to update/modify the inputs for producing 
        the desired output.</li>

It can process billions of instruction per second. Its speed is measured in terms of Millions of Instruction per second(MIPS).<br> Its formula is:<br> <b>Frequency</b>(hz)=1/<b>time</b>(Second or sec).<br> <b>For computer processing</b>,<br> <b>Frequency</b>=1/,<b>time</b>(micro second) </ol>
