    <h1>Computer in Robotics</h1>
    <p>Computers are at the heart of robotics, enabling intelligent control, automation, and decision-making capabilities. They power the brains of robots, processing sensor data, and executing complex algorithms to perform tasks. Computers enable robotic systems to perceive and interact with their environment, allowing them to navigate, manipulate objects, and perform intricate movements with precision. They also support machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, enabling robots to adapt, learn, and improve their performance over time.</p>

    <h1>Computer in CAM(Computer aided Manifacture)/CAD(Computer Aided Design)</h1>
    <p>CAD and CAM systems rely on computers to design and manufacture products with high accuracy and efficiency. CAD software enables engineers and designers to create detailed digital models of products, allowing for precise 2D or 3D representations. These computer-generated designs are then used in CAM systems to generate manufacturing instructions, control machinery, and automate production processes. Computers play a vital role in transforming concepts into tangible products by facilitating seamless integration between design and manufacturing stage</p>
