    enormpus speed.</li>
    
   <br> <li> A <b> computer </b> may be defined as an electronic machine that can solve problems by accepting data,performing 
    certain operations, and presenting result to those operations in sequential instruction that can store storage device at 
    high speed </li> 
    
   
    
    
   <br> <li> A <b>computer</b> can be defined as a proggrammable <b>digital automatic machine</b>, which takes input from the
